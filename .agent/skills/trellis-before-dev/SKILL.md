description: "Discovers and injects project-specific coding guidelines from .trellis/spec/ before implementation begins. Reads spec indexes, pre-development checklists, and shared thinking guides for the target package. Use when starting a new coding task, before writing any code, switching to a different package, or needing to refresh project conventions and standards."

Read the relevant development guidelines before starting your task.

Execute these steps:

1. **Read current task artifacts**:
   - `prd.md` for requirements and acceptance criteria
   - `design.md` if present for technical design
   - `implement.md` if present for execution order and validation plan
   - `research/implicit-rules.md` if present for hidden target or project rules inferred during this task

2. **Read the project profile if present**:
   ```bash
   cat .trellis/project-profile.md
   ```
   Use it to choose validation commands and testing strategy. Do not assume TypeScript / Node validation.

3. **Discover packages and their spec layers**:
   ```bash
   python ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages
   ```

4. **Identify which specs apply** to your task based on:
   - Which package you're modifying (e.g., `cli/`, `docs-site/`)
   - What type of work (backend, frontend, unit-test, docs, etc.)
   - Any spec/research paths referenced by the task artifacts

5. **Read the spec index** for each relevant module:
   ```bash
   cat .trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md
   ```
   Follow the **"Pre-Development Checklist"** section in the index.

6. **Read the specific guideline files** listed in the Pre-Development Checklist that are relevant to your task. The index is NOT the goal — it points you to the actual guideline files (e.g., `error-handling.md`, `conventions.md`, `mock-strategies.md`). Read those files to understand the coding standards and patterns.

7. **Always read shared guides**:
   ```bash
   cat .trellis/spec/guides/index.md
   ```

8. **For C#/.NET projects, active code discovery**:
   - Actively use the `roslyn-codelens` MCP tools (e.g. `find_callers`, `find_references`, `get_type_hierarchy`, `get_symbol_context`) to analyze class structures and track dependencies before changing any files.

9. Understand the coding standards, hidden task rules, validation strategy, and patterns you need to follow, then proceed with your development plan.

This step is **mandatory** before writing any code.
