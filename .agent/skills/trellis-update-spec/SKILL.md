# Update Code-Spec - Curate Then Capture Executable Contracts

When you learn something valuable from debugging, implementation, review, or discussion, use this skill to decide whether it deserves to enter `.trellis/spec/`, then update the relevant code-spec documents only for accepted knowledge.

**Timing**: After completing a task, fixing a bug, or discovering a new pattern

If the active task contains `research/implicit-rules.md`, read it as candidate input. Do not promote all inferred rules by default. Most task-local discoveries should remain in the task unless the curator gate accepts them as durable project knowledge.

---

## Curator Gate (CRITICAL)

Do not write more documentation by default. Trellis specs are operational constraints for coding agents, not casual notes.

Before editing `.trellis/spec/`, test every candidate against these questions:

1. Is this knowledge already obvious from current source code?
2. Can this fact/signature/dependency be parsed/discovered instantly using Roslyn MCP (`roslyn-codelens` tools)?
3. Is it stable enough to preserve?
4. Is it atomic, or does it contain multiple rules?
5. Does it have a clear trigger condition?
6. Does it explain why the rule exists?
7. Is it verifiable by test, static check, review checklist, or human confirmation?
8. Does it have code anchors or a clear scope?
9. Could it become stale if code changes?
10. Does another spec already say the same thing?
11. Would this help an agent make a better code change?

If the answer to #11 is no, do not keep it. If the agent can discover the fact by reading current source code or querying Roslyn MCP, do not encode it as a Trellis spec.

> [!NOTE]
> **MCP vs. Spec Division of Labor**:
> - **Use `fast-context`** for LLM-based semantic code retrieval (answering "where is feature X implemented?").
> - **Use `roslyn-codelens`** for exact compiler-level C# facts (types, signatures, callers, dependencies, health checks).
> - **Verify before documenting**: Before writing or updating any spec, run `roslyn-codelens` tools (e.g. `get_symbol_context`, `find_references`) to check if the fact is already easily queryable or visible in code. If it is queryable, do NOT create a spec for it.
> - **Do not document** any fact that can be queried by these tools (e.g. "Class A implements Interface B"). Only document decisions, bugs/pitfalls, business invariants, and non-obvious constraints.

### What Specs Should Preserve

Keep only knowledge that code does not reliably express:

- business invariants
- compatibility constraints
- historical pitfalls
- operational assumptions
- cross-system contracts
- security or compliance constraints
- verification requirements
- team decisions that are not obvious from code
- bug lessons confirmed by humans, tests, incidents, or review

### Source Requirement

Do not promote a candidate into an active spec unless it is supported by at least one of:

- explicit user confirmation
- bug or incident history
- failing test or regression test
- PR review comment
- existing product requirement
- external API/client contract
- observed repeated agent failure confirmed by the user

Unsupported candidates are `NEEDS_HUMAN_CONFIRMATION`, not active specs.

`research/implicit-rules.md` can satisfy this source requirement only when the entry cites concrete evidence such as a user correction, failing test, repeated failure, code anchor, or review outcome. Low-confidence or speculative inferred rules stay in task research.

### Classification Labels

Classify each candidate as one of:

- `KEEP`: high-signal, still accurate, non-redundant, agent-useful.
- `ATOMIZE`: useful but too broad or narrative. Split into smaller atoms.
- `REWRITE`: useful but vague, unverifiable, missing `why`, triggers, or anchors.
- `MERGE`: duplicates another spec. Keep the stronger version and merge unique knowledge only.
- `DELETE`: restates current code, is obsolete, or provides no durable value.
- `ARCHIVE`: historically interesting but no longer active guidance.
- `NEEDS_HUMAN_CONFIRMATION`: possibly valuable, but not supported by code, tests, user confirmation, incident history, or review evidence.

Only `KEEP`, accepted `ATOMIZE`, accepted `REWRITE`, and accepted `MERGE` results should lead to edits.

### What To Reject

Reject specs that merely say:

- facts easily queryable via Roslyn MCP (e.g. which method has which parameters, which class inherits which base, which method calls which helper)
- which method calls which service
- which class inherits which base class
- which endpoint exists
- which files contain which logic
- which DTO fields currently exist
- what the current implementation does
- generic advice like "be careful"
- generic architecture commentary
- long historical narratives with no actionable rule
- rules without trigger conditions
- rules without a reason
- rules that cannot be verified or reviewed

Prefer deleting 10 weak specs over adding 1 vague spec.

## Code-Spec First Rule (CRITICAL)

In this project, "spec" for implementation work means **code-spec**:
- Executable contracts (not principle-only text)
- Concrete signatures, payload fields, env keys, and boundary behavior
- Testable validation/error behavior

This depth requirement applies only after the curator gate accepts the candidate as durable, non-redundant project knowledge.

If the change touches infra or cross-layer contracts, code-spec depth is mandatory.

### Mandatory Triggers

Apply code-spec depth when the change includes any of:
- New/changed command or API signature
- Cross-layer request/response contract change
- Database schema/migration change
- Infra integration (storage, queue, cache, secrets, env wiring)

### Mandatory Output (7 Sections)

For triggered tasks, include all sections below:
1. Scope / Trigger
2. Signatures (command/API/DB)
3. Contracts (request/response/env)
4. Validation & Error Matrix
5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
6. Tests Required (with assertion points)
7. Wrong vs Correct (at least one pair)

## When to Consider Code-Spec Updates

| Trigger | Example | Target Spec |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Implemented a feature** | Added a new integration or module | Relevant spec file |
| **Made a design decision** | Chose extensibility pattern over simplicity | Relevant spec + "Design Decisions" section |
| **Fixed a bug** | Found a subtle issue with error handling | Relevant spec (e.g., error-handling docs) |
| **Discovered a pattern** | Found a better way to structure code | Relevant spec file |
| **Hit a gotcha** | Learned that X must be done before Y | Relevant spec + "Common Mistakes" section |
| **Established a convention** | Team agreed on naming pattern | Quality guidelines |
| **New thinking trigger** | "Don't forget to check X before doing Y" | `guides/*.md` (as a checklist item) |
| **Implicit rule confirmed during explore** | `research/implicit-rules.md` captured a repeated failure or user correction | Relevant atom only after curator gate |

**Key Insight**: Code-spec updates are not just for problems, but not every feature deserves a spec. Capture only decisions and contracts that future AI/developers need to execute safely and cannot reliably infer from code.

## Spec Structure Overview

```
.trellis/spec/
├── <layer>/           # Per-layer coding standards (e.g., backend/, frontend/, api/)
│   ├── index.md       # Overview and links
│   └── *.md           # Topic-specific guidelines
└── guides/            # Thinking checklists (NOT coding specs!)
    ├── index.md       # Guide index
    └── *.md           # Topic-specific guides
```

### CRITICAL: Atom vs Guideline vs Guide - Know the Difference

The directory tree above is only the layer overview. Active spec atoms belong in an `atoms/` directory under the owning layer:

```text
.trellis/spec/<layer>/atoms/<atom-name>.md
.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/atoms/<atom-name>.md
```

Normal `<layer>/*.md` files are guideline/overview documents. They should route to atoms and summarize when to read them, not duplicate active atom rules.

| Type | Location | Purpose | Content Style |
|------|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Guideline** | `<layer>/*.md` | Route and summarize layer conventions | Overview, links, short checklists |
| **Spec Atom** | `<layer>/atoms/*.md` | Tell AI "how to implement safely" | Frontmatter, Rule, Why, verification |
| **Guide** | `guides/*.md` | Help AI "what to think about" | Checklists, questions, pointers to specs |

**Current Decision Rule (authoritative)**:

- "This is a durable, evidence-backed **rule**" -> Put in `<layer>/atoms/`
- "This is **how a layer is organized or what to read**" -> Put in a layer guideline document and link atoms
- "This is **what to consider** before writing" -> Put in `guides/`

Legacy wording below is superseded when it conflicts with the `atoms/` placement rule.

**Decision Rule**: Ask yourself:

- "This is **how to write** the code" → Put in a spec layer directory
- "This is **what to consider** before writing" → Put in `guides/`

**Example**:

| Learning | Wrong Location | Correct Location |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| "Use API X not API Y for this task" | ❌ `guides/` (too specific for a thinking guide) | ✅ Relevant spec file (concrete convention) |
| "Remember to check X when doing Y" | ❌ Spec file (too abstract for a spec) | ✅ `guides/` (thinking checklist) |

**Guides should be short checklists that point to specs**, not duplicate the detailed rules.

---

## Update Process

### Step 1: Identify What You Learned

Answer these questions:

1. **What did you learn?** (Be specific)
2. **Why is it important?** (What problem does it prevent?)
3. **What evidence supports it?** (User confirmation, test, bug, review, external contract, or repeated confirmed failure)
4. **Where does it belong?** (Which spec file?)

### Step 2: Run the Curator Gate

Classify the candidate with the labels above.

- If it is `DELETE`, `ARCHIVE`, or `NEEDS_HUMAN_CONFIRMATION`, do not write an active spec.
- If it restates current code, skip it.
- If it duplicates existing spec content, merge only unique knowledge.
- If it is broad or narrative, atomize it before writing.

### Step 3: Classify the Accepted Update Type

| Type | Description | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Design Decision** | Why we chose approach X over Y | Add to "Design Decisions" section |
| **Project Convention** | How we do X in this project | Add to relevant section with examples |
| **New Pattern** | A reusable approach discovered | Add to "Patterns" section |
| **Forbidden Pattern** | Something that causes problems | Add to "Anti-patterns" or "Don't" section |
| **Common Mistake** | Easy-to-make error | Add to "Common Mistakes" section |
| **Convention** | Agreed-upon standard | Add to relevant section |
| **Gotcha** | Non-obvious behavior | Add warning callout |

### Step 4: Read the Target Layer

Before editing, read the target layer `index.md` and relevant guideline/atom files to:
- Understand existing structure
- Avoid duplicating content
- Find the right atom or decide whether a new atom is justified

```bash
cat .trellis/spec/<layer>/index.md
cat .trellis/spec/<layer>/atoms/<file>.md
```

### Step 5: Make the Update

Follow these principles:

1. **Be Specific**: Include concrete examples, not just abstract rules
2. **Explain Why**: State the problem this prevents
3. **Show Contracts**: Add signatures, payload fields, and error behavior
4. **Show Code**: Add code snippets for key patterns
5. **Keep it Short**: One concept per section

### Step 6: Update the Index (if needed)

If you added, moved, merged, archived, or deleted an atom, update the layer's `index.md`. Keep normal guideline files as routing/overview documents and avoid duplicating atom rules there.

## Update Templates

### Preferred Spec Atom Shape

Create active atoms as standalone Markdown files under `<layer>/atoms/`. When creating a new active spec atom, include:

- `id`
- `type`
- `priority`
- `applies_when`
- `code_anchors` or `scope`
- `verify` or `review`
- `source`
- `last_checked`
- `Rule`
- `Why`

Use this shape when adding a standalone spec file:

```markdown
---
id: order.cancel.worker-idempotency
type: pitfall
priority: must
applies_when:
  - modifying order cancellation worker
  - changing retry behavior
code_anchors:
  - src/Orders/OrderCancellationWorker.cs
verify:
  - duplicate worker execution is covered by a test
source:
  kind: human_confirmed
  ref: task-2026-06-02-order-cancel-worker
last_checked: 2026-06-02
---

# Rule

Order cancellation worker retries must not execute refund or audit side effects more than once.

# Why

A previous retry bug caused duplicate refund attempts when the worker retried after a timeout.
```

Recommended `type` values: `invariant`, `compatibility`, `pitfall`, `security`, `performance`, `operational`, `architecture_decision`, `testing_requirement`, `external_contract`, `migration_note`.

Use `priority: must` only when violating the rule can break production, compatibility, security, data integrity, money movement, compliance, or major user behavior.

### Mandatory Template for Infra/Cross-Layer Work

```markdown
## Scenario: <name>

### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: <why this requires code-spec depth>

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: ...
- Base: ...
- Bad: ...

### 6. Tests Required

// Don't do this
bad code example
\`\`\`

**Why it's bad**: Explanation of the issue.

## Relationship to Other Commands

```
Development Flow:
  Learn something → `update-spec` (Trellis command) → Knowledge captured
       ↑                                  ↓
  `break-loop` (Trellis command) ←──────────────────── Future sessions benefit
  (deep bug analysis)
```

- ``break-loop` (Trellis command)` - Analyzes bugs deeply, often reveals spec updates needed
- ``update-spec` (Trellis command)` - Actually makes the updates
- ``spec-curator` (Trellis skill)` - Use separately for broad review, pruning, atomization, or stale-spec cleanup across `.trellis/spec/`
- ``finish-work` (Trellis command)` - Reminds you to check if specs need updates

---

## Core Philosophy

> **Code-specs are living documents, but smaller is better when every remaining rule is high-signal.**

The goal is **institutional memory**:
- What one person learns, everyone benefits from
- What AI learns in one session, persists to future sessions
- Mistakes become documented guardrails

The boundary is strict: specs capture durable implementation constraints and verified lessons, not source summaries or speculative advice.
